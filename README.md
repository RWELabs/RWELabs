## About Us
RWE Labs, originally founded as RWE Softworks, is a subsidiary of Ryan Walpole Enterprises that is responsible for passion projects and hobby software that doesn't match the type of software released by RWE. RWE Labs currently offers a suite of useful tools and programs aimed primarily at video game enthusiasts, but could be home to any number of software products. Some of our more known projects include the Stardew Valley Mod Manager.
